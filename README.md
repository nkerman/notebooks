# COS-Notebooks

## Jupyter Notebooks of COS Data Processing Walkthroughs
Interactive walkthrough guides to common COS data procedures for PIs and other COS data users.

***Abstract***

1.  The **goal** of this project is to produce *Jupyter Notebooks* presenting walkthroughs of common data analysis procedures for data from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS).
    1.  A secondary goal is to investigate the feasibility of integrating STScI's DMD's `specutils` and `specvis` modules into these walkthrough notebooks, and into the COS team's general operations.
    2.  Some of the code to be used in these notebooks exists in disparate places across the COS team; one component of this project is *aggregating* existing knowledge into an accessible form.
    3.  Other HST teams have already begun similar programs, and this project will draw inspiration from WFC3 and other teams' existing notebooks.



2.  The **users/beneficiaries** of these notebooks will be users of COS data - PIs, graduate students, undergraduates, the public - who want to work with existing COS data.

    1.  These notebooks will intertactively teach the user to view a COS spectrum, re-bin COS data, combine COS FUV and NUV spectra into a master UV spectrum, etc.
    2.  They will also aim to *teach* the user how to determine the best parameters for a given procedure - i.e. choosing which binning they should apply to their data.
