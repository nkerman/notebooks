    "## 1.1. What is an LSF?\n",
    "A Line Spread Function (LSF) is a model of a spectrograph's response to a monochromatic light source: it explains how an infinitely thin spectral line (a [delta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function)) input into the spectrograph would be output at the focal plane. A spectrum with infinite sprectral resolution convolved with the COS LSF will reproduce the COS spectral line profiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$True\\ Input\\ Spectrum \\ast COS\\ LSF = True\\ Output\\ Spectrum$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we don't have access to a \"true\", infinite resolution input spectrum, nor can we know the infinite resolution LSF. The best we can do is use a model spectrum, or a spectrum from a higher resolution spectrograph (STIS often works well) and convolve it with a kernel of our LSF model. Convolving these yields our model output spectrum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Model\\ Input\\ Spectrum \\ast COS\\ LSF\\ Model = Model\\ Output\\ Spectrum$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note*** *that there is a corresponding spread function in the cross-dispersion direction, known as the cross-dispersion spread function (CDSF). These functions are also modelled by the COS team and hosted on their website listed below. Working with the CDSFs is out of the scope of this notebook.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does COS handle the LSF?\n",
    "\n",
    "The COS LSFs are generated using an optical model of the spectrograph in the program [Code V](https://www.synopsys.com/optical-solutions/codev.html), and are then validated using real spectral data obtained with the instrument. The LSF kernels are sampled at regular intervals over the wavelength range of each COS configuration. Each of these wavelengths thus corresponds to an LSF kernel. The kernel size (in [COS \"pixels\"](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosihb/glossary)) of each LSF varies for the near ultraviolet (NUV) and far ultraviolet (FUV) modes, as does the sample rate (how many Angstroms between sampled kernels). These values are shown below:\n",
