    "#### The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ([*COS*](https://www.nasa.gov/content/hubble-space-telescope-cosmic-origins-spectrograph)) is an ultraviolet spectrograph on-board the Hubble Space Telescope([*HST*](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/about)) with capabilities in the near ultraviolet (*NUV*) and far ultraviolet (*FUV*). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### This tutorial aims to prepare you to work with the COS data of your choice by walking you through filtering `TIME-TAG` datapoints obtained by COS. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, this tutorial will walk you through separating datapoints obtained during the Hubble Space Telescope's \"night\" - when the sun is below the geometric horizon from the observatory's point of view - from datapoints taken during the observatory's \"day\" - when the sun is above this horizon. \n",
    "You may wish to segregate photons from these two time periods, as data taken during the day can be subject to different and higher background noise conditions, as well as more intense geocoronal Lyman-alpha or Oxygen-I emission lines from the Earthâ€™s atmosphere ([See Data Handbook 5.4.2](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-5-cos-data-analysis/5-4-working-with-time-tag-data#id-5.4WorkingwithTIME-TAGData-5.4.2FilteringTime-TagData)).\n",
    "This type of data separation is possible with the [`TIME-TAG` data](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-1-cos-overview/1-1-instrument-capabilities-and-design) obtained by the COS photon-counting detectors, because each individual encounter with a photon is recorded with its own metadata such as the time of the encounter, and the physical position of Hubble at that time.\n",
