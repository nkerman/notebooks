    "# 0. Introduction\n",
    "#### The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ([*COS*](https://www.nasa.gov/content/hubble-space-telescope-cosmic-origins-spectrograph)) is an ultraviolet spectrograph on-board the Hubble Space Telescope([*HST*](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/about)) with capabilities in the near ultraviolet (*NUV*) and far ultraviolet (*FUV*). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### This tutorial aims to prepare you to work with the COS data of your choice by walking you through filtering `TIME-TAG` datapoints obtained by COS. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, this tutorial will walk you through separating datapoints obtained during the Hubble Space Telescope's \"night\" - when the sun is below the geometric horizon from the observatory's point of view - from datapoints taken during the observatory's \"day\" - when the sun is above this horizon. This type of data separation is possible with the [`TIME-TAG` data](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-1-cos-overview/1-1-instrument-capabilities-and-design) obtained by the COS photon-counting detectors, because each individual encounter with a photon is recorded with its own metadata such as the time of the encounter, and the physical position of Hubble at that time.\n",

    "With substantially fewer datapoints, our filtered dataset has significantly larger errors. We can, however, understand why we might want to filter by this, or another `sun_alt` filter. For instance, if most of your exposure was taken at night, but the last 10% was taken after the sun had risen and induced an atmospheric line which interferes with your data, it would be necessary to filter out this last 10% of the exposure."
