# COS Notebooks

## Jupyter Notebook Walkthroughs of Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) Data Processing
The [Cosmic Origins Spectrograph](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/cos) (COS) is an instrument on the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/about) (HST).
This is a repository of interactive walkthrough guides to common COS data procedures. It is intended for any and all COS data users: from undergraduates, to professional astronomers, to the general public.

## Currently Operational Notebooks

If you don't want to run the notebooks for yourself but just want to see rendered html versions of the notebooks, *(with outputs,)* you may use the rendered `html` file.

## Basic Requirements

If you have never used Jupyter/IPython Notebooks before, please see the [Jupyter/IPython Notebook Quick Start Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

While you *can* run most of the notebooks with only the `ipynb` file downloaded, it is **highly recommended that you clone this entire repository**. Specifically, `ViewData.ipynb` cannot run at present without both the `Scripts` and `ViewData` subdirectories installed side-by-side.

You need to be able to run Jupyter Notebooks and install python packages. If you don't have Jupyter installed, continue reading, or see the [Jupyter Docs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for much more detailed installation instructions.

If you have `pip` or `conda` installed:


|`pip`|`conda` (**strongly preferred**)|
|-----|--------------------------------|
|`pip install jupyterlab`|`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`|


If you don't have the `conda` tool: 

We recommend installing either the Anaconda or Minicoda distributions. See [this page](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#getting-started-jump) for instructions, and install either of the following: 

|Conda Distribution (with link to download)|Short Description|Size|
|-|-|-|
|[`anaconda` Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) | More beginner friendly, with lots of extras you likely won't use| \~ 3 GB|
|[`miniconda` Distribution](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)| Bare-bones conda distribution, which allows you to download only what you need|\~ 400 MB|

These will install the conda command line tool, allowing you to run `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`. 

Next, if you don't have experience installing packages, you should begin with our notebook [Setup.ipynb](https://github.com/nkerman/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/COS/Setup/Setup.ipynb) on setting up an environment for running astronomical code, or read the pre-rendered version [here](https://spacetelescope.github.io/COS-Notebooks/Setup.html).

## Getting Help

If you have an issue using these notebooks which you cannot fix, or if believe you have discovered an error in a notebook, please reach out to the [HST Help Desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/hst) or to the notebook's primary author: <nkerman@stsci.edu>.
