    "You may wish to segregate photons from these two time periods, as data taken during the day can be subject to different and higher background noise conditions, as well as more intense geocoronal Lyman-alpha or Oxygen-I emission lines from the Earthâ€™s atmosphere ([See Data Handbook 5.4.2](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-5-cos-data-analysis/5-4-working-with-time-tag-data#id-5.4WorkingwithTIME-TAGData-5.4.2FilteringTime-TagData)).\n",
    "This type of data separation is possible with the [`TIME-TAG` data](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-1-cos-overview/1-1-instrument-capabilities-and-design) obtained by the COS photon-counting detectors, because each individual encounter with a photon is recorded with its own metadata such as the time of the encounter, and the physical position of Hubble at that time.\n",
